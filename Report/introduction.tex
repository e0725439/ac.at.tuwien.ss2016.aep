In this project we investigated the double sided matching problem (also known as the stable matching problem) along with its application in economics. At the beginning a theoretical overview in algorithmic game theory is provided. Afterwards we implemented a functional prototype in NetLogo\cite{netlogo}. This prototype was evaluated based on two matching problems: matching of students seeking an university place and universities offering those places in Austria and the matching of the labor supply and labor demand in the European Union.

Clemens will be here!
