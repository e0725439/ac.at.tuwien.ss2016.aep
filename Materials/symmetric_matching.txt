Symmetric two-sided matching

This is a replication model of the matching problem including the mate search problem, which is the generalization of a traditional optimization problem.
Peter Todd and Geoffery Miller conducted a simulation for two-sided matching problem in symmetric setting in 1999(*). In their model there are the same number of agents in two parties, each of whom has his/her own mate value. Each agent in both parties tries to find his/her mate in the other party based on his/her candidate’s mate value and his/her own aspiration level for the partner’s mate values. Each agent learns his/her own mate value and adjusts his/her aspiration level through the trial period (adolescence). Todd and Miller tried a several search rules and the learning mechanisms. The rules and the mechanisms are symmetric for both parties in this setting. This NetLogo model is a replication of their model.
